# HTML-and-CSS-Practice
Results of working through tutorials to learn these interpreted languages
The HTML was done while working through the tutorials on developer.mozilla.org.  Some of it is directly copied, but the goofy stuff is all mine.  I also created it as a sort of notes/reference for when I can't find the notebook I was writing in at the time.  It is nothing fancy, a bit light-hearted and might be useful when my mind goes blank.
