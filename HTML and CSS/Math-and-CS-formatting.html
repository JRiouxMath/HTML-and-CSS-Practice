        <h1>Sub and Super Scripts</h1>

        <p>These are easy enough. &lt;sup&gt; marks the enclosed text as a superscript and &lt;sub&gt; marks it as a subscript.
            Thus we can calculate x<sub>n</sub> to the 5<sup>th</sup> power.
        </p>

        <h1>Coding Markups</h1>

        <p>Of course I'm going to write code, and it needs to look like code! When I teach "Hello World" it should be obvious what is
            coded and how it should look. I'll use the variable <var>theString</var> to store the string and then output it. </p>

            <pre><code>
            String theString = new String ("Hello world");

            System.out.println(theString);
            </code></pre>

        Notice that in the presentation element, indicated by &lt;pre&gt; the whitespace is absolute.  It won't adjust to the screen.
        The output should be <samp>Hello world</samp>.

         <h1>Time</h1>

         <hr>

        <p>Every one has an opinion for how to write the date and time, and some situations require specific forms.  Also, all the 
            variety can make things more complex for poor, simple-minded computer.

        <ul>
            <li><time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time></li>
            <!-- Just year and month -->
            <li><time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time></li>
            <!-- Just month and day -->
            <li><time datetime="01-20">20 January</time></li>

            <li><time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time></li>

        <p>Here is where I'd put all that legal mumbo-jumbo about how it's all mine, don't take it, or how to contact me.</p>
