        <h2>Hyperlinks Notes</h2>
        
        <p>I don't really feel like getting into this right now, but it might be good to have it here as a reference.
            For further reference, go back to the 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks" target="_blank">Mozilla tutorial</a>
            and learn more.
        </p>

        <p>The <strong>root</strong> is the folder that all the files are kept in for the webpage. A <strong>directory</strong>
            is a folder within the root.  This is good for keeping things together like pdfs or data files.
        </p>

        <p>If you are linking to something in the same directory, just give the <em>filename</em>.  To go down a directory, 
            use directory_name / file_name. To go up a directory, use "../" and file_name.  These can be chained as needed.  These 
            are considered <strong>relative URL</strong>s.  
        </p>

        <p>To link to something outside your page you must use the full URL. This is an <strong>absolute URL</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Common practices include alerting the user when a link will involve special circumstances including downloading, streaming
            requiring a Flash player or leaving a secured site.
        </p>

        <p>It is also possible to link to an email server with special cases such as including cc, bc and attachments or using 
            a specific server.

        <h2>Abbreviations</h2>

        <p>Since we love abbreviating things, we have to be aware that not everyone will know what the abbreviation or achronym stands for.
            HTML has an element to address this.  Originally they created one for each case, but they are so similar that the achronym one
            is no longer supported and rarely used. Use &lt;abbr&gt; in either case.  This will add a tooltip that will show the full word
            title.  
        </p>

        <p> <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> is an amazing organization.  It has an official title recognized by the world, but there is also Kaulin's version of
            <abbr title="Nerds Are So Awesome">NASA</abbr>.
