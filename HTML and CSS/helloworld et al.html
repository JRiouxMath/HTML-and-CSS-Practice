        Quilting is a glorious activity.  It has been shown to have theraputic effects.
        Indeed some have claimed <em>I don't need prozak, I need a trip 
          to the fabric store</em>

      <p>
        Quilting is a multisensory activity.  You can <b> feel </b> <i> see</i>
        <strong> smell </strong> the fabric as you become one with it.
