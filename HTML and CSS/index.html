    <p>Check out my page on <a href="Header games.html">Headers.</a></p>
    <p>Check out my page on <a href="listings.html">Lists.</a>  It comes with a hummus recipe</p>
    <p>Check out my page on <a href="meta-stuff.html">Meta-Data.</a> Sadly, the good stuff is hidden, But it's mostly copied anyway.</p>
    <p>This was the <a href="helloworld et al.html">first</a> page. I played around with a few things.</p>
    <p>Here is a <a href="URLsAbbretc.html"> page</a> of more advanced topics like hyperlinks and abbreviations</p>
    <p>Now we're rolling! Time to format <a href="Math-and-CS-formatting.html"> mathy and cody</a> stuff.</p>
    <p>To learn about other elements, go to <a href="More-Elements.html">this page</a>.  I finally got to &lt;div&gt; which I've wanted to understand for some time now.</p>
    <p>Having become "Grandmaster of HTML" I have moved on to <a href="Trying CSS.html"> CSS.</a></p>
    <p>The journey continues through <a href="selectors-html.html">Selectors.</a></p>

    <p>Here is where I'd put all that legal mumbo-jumbo about how it's all mine, don't take it, or how to contact me.</p>
    <p>I would also like to publicly acknowledge that in no way do I claim this to be a beautiful piece of art worthy
      of being in the public arena.  I made it to learn.  It serves as a simple reference for many of the things 
      possible as I continue my foray into the cold, dark world of computer science, particularly on my current
      heading which leads into Android Studio.  I expect to drag many innocents with me.
