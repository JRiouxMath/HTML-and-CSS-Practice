        <h2>Non Semantic Elements</h2>
        
        <h3>Span</h3>

            <p>This is an inline element that is a bit of a catch-all. Use it when there isn't a better one to use or if you want
                to do specific formatting in css
            </p>

        <h3>Div</h3>
            
            <p>
                Similiar to <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> this is used when you don't have a pre-made element.  This one works on a block.
                Be careful.  According to Mozilla, they are overused and can add unneccesary clutter.
